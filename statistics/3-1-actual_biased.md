[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> The following graph shows the actual and biased distribtions of the responses to the survey of the number of children per household. The biased group includes the responses of the children of the families, which leaves out important data of families who have zero children, and inflates the number of large families as children with many siblings are more likely to respond to the survey.
